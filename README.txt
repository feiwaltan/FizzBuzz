Example of FizzBuzz

The code can be compiled to run from the commnad prompt as well as run from compiler.

If you want to run the code form compiler you can run the TestLib.java, this will show test running which were used to create the library and test it out.

I've made the function so that you can run a default instance, which is going to run with loop from firstValue to secondValue and pirint out the words defined.

If you want to change the range you can do that with set methods, as I'm using the get method in the defaultInstance(), 
so you could run multiple instance of this and with different falues set for first and second, as well as changing of words can be done as well, with its own set method.

=======================================================================================================

To use the library just download the FizzBuzzLib.jar and you can use it on your machine to build out you application where you can use the defaultInstance to run the initial code.

After that you can set the firstValue and secondValue as well as different words if you like. You coudl call the same method again defaultInstance, which will just loop throug all the number and print out the results to console.

If you want to save the results to a file you would need to just create your own loop and call the fizzBuzz method, which takes a value and string[] and returns a string back to you.
